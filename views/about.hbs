                            Hello! I am Parampreet Singh, a passionate programmer and a student at Georgian College pursuing my studies in Computer Science.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I have a strong foundation in several programming languages including Java, JavaScript, and C#.NET. I am particularly interested in web development and have hands-on experience with frameworks like Express.js and ASP.NET MVC.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            In addition to my coursework, I actively contribute to open-source projects on GitHub, where you can find my repositories showcasing projects ranging from simple applications to more complex software solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            I enjoy learning new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. Currently, I am focusing on improving my skills in frontend development with React.js and exploring cloud computing platforms like AWS.
                        </p>
                        <p class="card-text">
                            Outside of programming, I am an avid reader and enjoy playing tennis. Feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://github.com/paramsandhu2103">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a> to learn more about my projects and experiences.
